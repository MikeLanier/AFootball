	</p>
	<p>
		Before the regular sequence of play is explained it is important to understand how to use the Play / Action Charts 
		which are essential to the gameâ€™s play.  After the charts have been explained the sequence of play will be easily understood. 
	 </p>
	<p>
		Use of the Game Charts: Each team has its own Play / Action Chart (Offensive Plays on one side and Defensive Plays and Special 
		Teams on the other side).  Except for the use of the Special Teams Charts (for Kickoffs, Punts, etc), the game is basically a 
		sequence of selecting a play, rolling the dice to see the result of the play, and then comparing the individual Offensive and 
		Defensive results on a third chart which shows the final result of what the play will be.  This third chart, located on a 
		separate sheet, is called the Priority Chart.

	<p>
		<font color="lightgreen">Offensive Play Charts</font>: After the kickoff and return is completed, the player on Offense selects one of the nine plays on his 
		Offensive Play Chart and records this play by turning the dial to the corre-sponding number on the Play Selector on the board, 
		making certain to shield his selection from his opponent
